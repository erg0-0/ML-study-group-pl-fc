This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
##In order to fit a multiple linear regression model using least squares, we again use the lm() function. The syntax lm(y∼x1+x2+x3) is used to fit a model with three predictors, x1, x2, and x3.

##INTERACTION TERMS (The syntax lstat:black tells R to include an interaction term between lstat and black. The syntax lstat*age simultaneously includes lstat, age, and the interaction term lstat×age as predictors; it is a shorthand for lstat+age+lstat:age.)
summary(lm(medv~lstat*age,data=Boston))
```
```{r}
#NON-LINEAR TRANSFORMATIONS OF PREDICTORS

#The lm() function can also accommodate non-linear transformations of the predictors. For instance, given a predictor X, we can create a predictor X2 using I(X^2). The function I() is needed since the ^ has a special meaning in a formula; wrapping as we do allows the standard usage in R, which is I() to raise X to the power 2. We now perform a regression of medv onto lstat and lstat2

lm.fit2=lm(medv~lstat+I(lstat^2))
summary(lm.fit2)
```

```{r}
#The near-zero p-value associated with the quadratic term suggests that it leads to an improved model. We use the anova() function to further quantify the extent to which the quadratic fit is superior to the linear fit.
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat)
anova(lm.fit, lm.fit2)
```

```{r}
#Here Model 1 represents the linear submodel containing only one predictor, lstat, while Model 2 corresponds to the larger quadratic model that has two predictors, lstat and lstat2. The anova() function performs a hypothesis test comparing the two models. The null hypothesis is that the two models fit the data equally well, and the alternative hypothesis is that the full model is superior. Here the F-statistic is 135 and the associated p-value is virtually zero. This provides very clear evidence that the model containing the predictors lstat and lstat2 is far superior to the model that only contains the predictor lstat. This is not surprising, since earlier we saw evidence for non-linearity in the relationship between medv and lstat. If we type the code below, then we see that when the lstat2 term is included in the model, there is little discernible pattern in the residuals.

```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit2)
```

```{r}
#In order to create a cubic fit, we can include a predictor of the form I(X^3). However, this approach can start to get cumbersome for higher- order polynomials. A better approach involves using the poly() function to create the polynomial within lm(). For example, the following command produces a fifth-order polynomial fit:
lm.fit5=lm(medv~poly(lstat,5))
summary(lm.fit5)
```
```{r}
#This suggests that including additional polynomial terms, up to fifth order, leads to an improvement in the model fit! However, further investigation of the data reveals that no polynomial terms beyond fifth order have significant p-values in a regression fit. Of course, we are in no way restricted to using polynomial transforma- tions of the predictors. Here we try a log transformation.

#QUALITATIVE PREDICTORS
#We will now examine the Carseats data, which is part of the ISLR library. We will attempt to predict Sales (child car seat sales) in 400 locations based on a number of predictors.

fix(Carseats)
names(carseats)
```

```{r} 
#T118 he Carseats data includes qualitative predictors such as Shelveloc, an indicator of the quality of the shelving location —that is, the space within a store in which the car seat is displayed —at each location. The predictor Shelveloc takes on three possible values, Bad, Medium, and Good. Given a qualitative variable such as Shelveloc, R generates dummy variables automatically. Below we fit a multiple regression model that includes some interaction terms.

```

```{r}
fix(Carseats)
names(Carseats)
lm.fit=lm(Sales~.+Income:Advertising+Price:Age,data=Carseats)
summary(lm.fit)
```

```{r}
#The contrasts() function returns the coding that R uses for the dummy variables.
attach(Carseats)
contrasts(ShelveLoc)
```
```{r}
?contrasts
#R has created a ShelveLocGood dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 if the shelving location is good, and 0 otherwise. It has also created a ShelveLocMedium dummy variable that equals 1 if the shelving location is medium, and 0 otherwise. A bad shelving location corresponds to a zero for each of the two dummy variables. The fact that the coefficient for ShelveLocGood in the regression output is positive indicates that a good shelving location is associated with high sales (relative to a bad location). And ShelveLocMedium has a smaller positive coefficient, indicating that a medium shelving location leads to higher sales than a bad shelving location but lower sales than a good shelving location.

#WRITING FUNCTIONS
#below we provide a simple function that reads in the ISLR and MASS libraries, called LoadLibraries(). Before we have created the function, R returns an error if we try to call it.

#Note that the + symbols are printed by R and should not be typed in. The { symbol informs R that multiple commands are about to be input. Hitting Enter after typing { will cause R to print the + symbol. We can then input as many commands as we wish, hitting Enter after each one. Finally the } symbol informs R that no further commands will be entered.

LoadLibraries=function (){
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
print("The libaries have been loaded.")
}
